    "  - Tools to fine-tune LLMs efficiently without handling all billions of parameters (includes methods like LoRA).\n",
    "- `trl` (Transformer Reinforcement Learning)\n",
    "  - Encompasses techniques such as reward modeling, proximal policy optimization (PPO), and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) – key to advancements like ChatGPT.\n",
    "- `accelerate`\n",
    "  - Facilitates distributed computing for training and inference, scaling across multiple GPUs."
