    "Weights & Biases (W&B) is an AI developer platform that offers tools for:\n",
    "- Training and fine-tuning models\n",
    "- Tracking experiments\n",
    "- Managing datasets and models\n",
    "- Evaluating outputs\n",
    "- Collaborating and sharing insights\n",
    "\n",
    "It comprises three main components:\n",
    "- **W&B Models**: Tools for experiment tracking, hyperparameter tuning, and model registry.\n",
    "- **W&B Weave**: A toolkit for tracking and evaluating large language model (LLM) applications.\n",
    "- **W&B Core**: Foundational features like artifacts, tables, and reports for data and model management."
