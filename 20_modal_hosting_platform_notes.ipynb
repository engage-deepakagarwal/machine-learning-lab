    "- Steady State\n",
    "  - The container(s) remain running 24/7, load-balanced by Modal’s infrastructure.\n",
    "  - You can configure autoscaling rules (min/max replicas, concurrency per container).\n",
    "- Requests Handling\n",

    "  - When you push a code change or new container image, Modal rolls out updated instances with zero downtime (blue/green or rolling updates).\n",

    "- Statefulness (Intermediate):\n",
    "  - While containers are long-lived, you still shouldn’t rely on in-process memory for permanent storage.\n",
    "  - However, you can maintain caches or keep loaded LLM weights in GPU memory across multiple requests for low-latency inference.\n",
    "- Minimal Cold-Start:\n",
    "  - Because containers stay warm, you avoid repeated startup delays. Only scale-out (adding new replicas) may incur a slight delay.\n",
    "- Autoscaling\n",
    "  - Modal lets you specify concurrency targets or CPU/GPU utilization thresholds. If usage surges, it brings up new replicas automatically.\n",
    "- Billing Model\n",
    "  - You pay for the allocated CPU/GPU and memory continuously, regardless of request volume\n",
    "  - More cost-effective for sustained, predictable traffic.\n",

    "  - Exposes a stable public (or private) URL.\n",
    "  - TLS termination, authentication (via API keys or JWT), and custom domains are supported."
