# LLM Engineering
This is my own follow-through notes and code inspired from the Udemy course [LLM Engineering: Master AI, Large Language Models & Agents](https://www.udemy.com/course/llm-engineering-master-ai-and-large-language-models/) by [Ed Donner](https://www.udemy.com/user/ed-donner-3/)

By default, this will use locally hosted LLM (llama3.2) using Ollama intentionally.
